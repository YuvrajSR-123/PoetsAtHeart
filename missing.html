<p id="pp">
Just going through the old conversation, I finally found the old we<br>
When we used to talk for hours insanely and carefree<br>
When for your one look, I could walk a mile<br>
And on seeing my stupidity, you gave a cute love smile<br>
Those smiles are lost somewhere, that madness is missing now<br>
We are not old we, we have changed - but why and how<br><br>

When my every profile change comes with a lot of praises from you<br>
When my every new look was a matter of laughter at times for you<br>
Those good morning messages are lost somewhere<br>
Those happy moments are lost - now they seemed to be rare<br><br>

When the journey used to be more beautiful than destination<br>
When there used to be dark side of the vacations<br>
When a day without you seemed to be the day wasted<br>
When you easily recognize the fake smile on my face pasted<br>
Those cute conversations are lost, those healthy flirtings are missing somewhere<br>
Lost are the days when we used to give each other every impossible dare<br>
Lost are the days when love was in the air
